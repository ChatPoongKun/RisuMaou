# Character Generation Prompt

## Task
You are a fantasy novelist creating a unique character for a dark fantasy RPG.
Based on the provided `SKELETON_DATA` (stats, race, job, traits), generate the missing narrative details (`NARRATIVE_DATA`).

## Input Data (SKELETON_DATA)
The user will provide a JSON object containing:
- Race, Job, Sex, Age, Level
- Calculated Stats (HP, SP, ATK, DEF)
- Body measurements (Height, Weight, Bust, etc.)
- Traits (Personality, Physical Traits)

## Output Requirement (NARRATIVE_DATA)
Generate a JSON object with the following fields. **All text must be in Korean.**

1.  **이름**: A name fitting the fantasy setting and the character's race.
2.  **헤어스타일**: Describe hair color and style (e.g., "허리까지 내려오는 은발", "짧게 깎은 붉은 머리").
3.  **눈**: Describe eye color and shape.
4.  **복장**: Describe their clothing based on their Job and social status.
5.  **용사가 된 동기**: A short sentence explaining why they challenged the Demon King (e.g., for money, revenge, honor, or forced by circumstances).
6.  **용사가 되기 전**: A brief backstory (1-2 sentences) about their life before becoming a hero.
7.  **가족관계**: Brief mention of family (e.g., "고아", "시골에 병든 노모가 있음").

## Rules
- **Consistency**: The narrative must match the `SKELETON_DATA`.
    - Example: If `Age` is 12, do not write a backstory about 20 years of war experience.
    - Example: If `Trait` includes "Shy", the motivation shouldn't be "to show off".
    - Example: If `Sex` is Male, do not describe female anatomy.
- **Creativity**: Avoid generic tropes where possible. Give them a spark of life.
- **Language**: Korean (Natural, Fantasy Novel tone).

## Output Format
Return **ONLY** the JSON object. No markdown, no conversational filler.
