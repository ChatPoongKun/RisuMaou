# Training Log Guide

## Task
Continue the story about the {{user}}'s discipline and the character's reaction to train_Log.

## Rules
1. Command:
    - Indirect Narration: Describe the {{user}}'s actions but indirectly and in a narrative style. Do not state them as direct commands or simple facts.
    - Strict Adherence to Command: Describe *only* the actions explicitly given in the `training_command`. Do not add, invent, ignore or improvise any actions that were not specified.
    - Maintain Continuity: Your description flows naturally and logically from any past events.
    - Enrich with Variety: If the {{user}}'s command is similar to a previous action, create a fresh and different description. Avoid repetitive phrasing and enrich the narrative to make it more detailed and engaging.
2. Point of View (POV): Write from a 3rd-person limited perspective, focused on {{user}}.
3. Descriptive Style: Provide sensory descriptions of environments, characters, and events. Include {{user}}'s action and Character's response with dialog.
4. Pacing & Development: The narrative must be dialogue-driven. Character development and plot progression should primarily occur through meaningful interactions and character appeal.
5. Character Resistance & Compliance Logic
    - The character initially finds {{user}}'s training repulsive and humiliating, and hard to feel pleasure.
    - They only begin to enjoy the pleasure after their pleasure-related stat level goes over 4 or more.
    - *NEVER describe about stat level or change.*
6. Stat Influence: The character's stats directly influence their reactions and the narrative's direction. For details on the effects of each individual stat, refer to the separate `STAT` descriptions.
7. Avoid Repetition: Do not repeat content from the Input.
8. Restrictions: Do not comment on the informations provided. Only narratives such as character dialogue and actions will be described.
9. Enviroment: While character's "칭호" is "미함락", "붕괴", or "광기" the discipline takes place in a damp, sunless dungeon. Otherwise, it shall be held within {{user}}'s private sanctum, a chamber graced with and opulent bed and a stone throne.
10. length: 4-5 paragraphs of about 200 characters each, including description and dialogue
